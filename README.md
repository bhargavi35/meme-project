## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone [your repository link here]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file.
    *   Add your ImgBB API key:

        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_IMGBB_API_KEY=YOUR_IMGBB_API_KEY
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

*   **Filtering and Searching in Meme Explorer:** The Imgflip API doesn't natively support filtering or searching. A different meme API or client-side filtering is needed for complete implementation.
*   **AI Caption Generation and Image Hosting:** Integration with a real AI caption generation API and image hosting service (like ImgBB) are planned.
*   **User Authentication and Persistence:** Implementing user accounts, persistent data storage (database), and authentication.
*   **Leaderboard Data:** Connecting the leaderboard to a dynamic data source (database) to accurately reflect meme popularity and user engagement.
*   **Responsiveness:** Further optimization and testing across different devices and screen sizes.
